# Critical Shears



### About

I was shearing my sheep one day, and thought it would go much faster if I could critically shear them. So, I made this mod. Whenever you shear a sheep with a critical hit, it is guaranteed to drop three wool instead of 1-3.

The server I was playing on wasn't actually a modded server though, so I don't really get to reap the rewards of this mod. I suppose you could call me a martyr. Thank me later.

Jokes aside, enjoy the mod!
